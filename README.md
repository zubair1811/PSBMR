# PSBMR For schooling Kids and Out of school learners
PSBMR is a reaserch based project how multi-armed bandit Algorithms cab be utilized to recommendation system for student learning. PSBMR is also used to motivate students to learn mathematics in real time learning environment.

#### How to use it:
* git clone https://github.com/zubair1811/PSBMR.git
Libraries For Framework
* Numpay
* Matplotlib
## How to start with PSBMR System
#### 1--check Simulation Directory   [Simulations](PSBMR/Recommendation_System/Simulations)
* check algorithm validity [Algorithm_Validation.py](PSBMR/Recommendation_System/Simulations/Algorithm_Validation.py) use run Function for   simulation: 
* run('1') for PSBMR validation 
* run('2') for Comparison between PSBMR and PES
#### 2-- check simulation with virtual students 
* [Bad_Student_(P)](Bad_Students_(P).py)
* [Good_Student_(Q)](PSBMR/Recommendation_System/Simulations/Good_Students_(Q).py)
